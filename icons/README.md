# Icons

This folder should contain the extension icons:

- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

You can create your own icons or use placeholder images. The icons should represent Gemini or AI assistant functionality.

For now, you can use any PNG images with these dimensions, or create simple colored squares as placeholders until you design proper icons.
